rbonvall's snippets for Snipmate
================================
These are my own snippet files for snipmate.vim_.

Most of the modifications I made to the `default snippets`_
are very specific to my own usage,
and I don't expect them to be useful for everyone.
Feel free to copy or to fork them,
or to take ideas from them.

.. _snipmate.vim: http://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate
.. _default snippets: https://github.com/honza/snipmate-snippets

I also maintain snippets for BibTeX_ and `Fortran 95`_
as separated repositories.
That's how I'd like that snippets for non-mainstream languages
were maintained in general.
Some of the current default snippets are too specific,
and unlikely to be useful to many people.
